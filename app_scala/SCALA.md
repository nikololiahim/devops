# Scala Tools Used

- [`Play 2` Framework](https://www.playframework.com/) - the most developed, fully featured web application framework
  that is still maintained to this day. This framework dictates the structure of the entire application.
- [`sbt`](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) - a de-facto standard tool to build and distribute Scala applications.
- [`scalatest`](https://www.scalatest.org/) - a very popular unit testing framework for Scala with extensions for `Play`
  , like [`scalatestplusplay`](https://github.com/playframework/scalatestplus-play), for example.
- [`sbt-docker-plugin`](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/docker.html) - a plugin for `sbt` to
  simplify the containerization of Scala applications.
