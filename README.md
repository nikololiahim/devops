This is a repository for labs of 2021 DevOps course at Innopolis University.

# Contents
This repository contains:
- 2 directories, one (`app_python`) for a Python web-app,
  and the other (`app_scala`) for an almost identical Scala web-app. 
  Each of these directories also contains `README.md` file with general project structure and descriptions
  and `PYTHON.md`/`SCALA.md` with an overview of tools and best practices used. 
  All this was a part of lab 1.
- `Dockerfile`s and `DOCKER.md` files with explanations explanations for lab2.
